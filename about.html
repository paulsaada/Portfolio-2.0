                  <p>My name is Paul Saada, as I'm sure you know by now.</p>
                  <p>I'm a skilled and highly driven full-stack
                     developer with core skills in front end development and a
                     working knowledge of back end technologies.</p>
                  <p>I'm currently employed at <a href="#">Interactive Nerd</a> as a frontend React Developer where I
                     get to work on
                     animated
                     user-facing features as well as developing tools for internal company use. While at my previous
                     role as a freelance developer, I built a website that increased conversions by +300% for one of my
                     clients, and I completed projects an average of 15% before target deadlines.</p>
